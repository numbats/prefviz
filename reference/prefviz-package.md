# prefviz: Visualizes preference data via ternary plots in two and higher dimensions

Visualises preference and ranking data by extending traditional ternary
plots to support high-dimensional simplexes. It provides methods to
transform compositional data into coordinates suitable for 2D and
high-dimensional ternary plots. Compatibility with interacitve
visualization packages such as \`plotly\` allows users to explore
high-dimensional preference structures dynamically.
