## Order of vertex labels

When customizing your aesthetic mappings, you might stumble upon the issue of mismatch 
in value between the base layer's aesthetic mappings and the aesthetic mapping of `geom_ternary_region()This is because `geom_ternary_region()` generates its own data and does not inherit the
aesthetic from the base layer. 
The issue commonly come in the message of `No shared levels found between `names(values)` of the manual scale and the data's fill values.`


You can specify the naming of the ternary regions using the `vertex_labels` argument. 
The default of `vertex_labels` is `c("Region 1", "Region 2", "Region 3")`.
