Description: Visualises preference and ranking data by extending traditional 
    ternary plots to support high-dimensional simplexes. It provides methods to 
    transform compositional data into coordinates suitable for 2D and high-dimensional
    ternary plots. Compatibility with interacitve visualization packages such as `plotly`
    allows users to explore high-dimensional preference structures dynamically.
