\title{Reorder observations for a path geom}
\format{
An object of class \code{StatOrdered} (inherits from \code{Stat}, \code{ggproto}, \code{gg}) of length 4.
}
\usage{
stat_ordered_path(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  geom = "path",
  position = "identity",
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE,
  decreasing = TRUE,
  na_method = c("drop_na", "drop_group"),
  ...

}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{ggplot2::aes()}}. Must
at least supply \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{order_by}. The \code{group} aesthetic can be used
to define separate paths.}

\item{data}{Data frame to be used for this layer. If \code{NULL}, the default,
the data is inherited from the plot.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use to draw the paths. Defaults to \code{"path"}.}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This
can be used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and
improving the display. The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example,
to use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{show.legend}{Logical or \code{NA}. Should this layer be included in the
legends? \code{NA}, the default, includes the layer if any aesthetics are
mapped.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than
combining with them.}

\item{decreasing}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, paths are ordered in decreasing order
of \code{order_by}. If \code{FALSE} (default), ordering is increasing.}

\item{na_method}{Character string specifying how to handle missing values in
\code{order_by}. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"drop_na"} (default): drop only rows where \code{order_by} is \code{NA};
\item \code{"drop_group"}: drop entire groups that contain any \code{NA} in \code{order_by}.
}}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed on to the underlying geom.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 layer that can be added to a plot object.
}
\description{
\code{stat_ordered_path()} reorders observations along each path using a user-supplied
ordering aesthetic (\code{order_by}) before drawing the path. The statistic can be
used to ensure that paths are drawn in a consistent order even when the input
data are not pre-sorted. This is equivalent to reordering the data before
passing it to \code{geom_path()}.
}
\details{
The statistic expects an \code{order_by} aesthetic that supplies the variable used
to order observations within each group.

Missing values \code{order_by} are handled according to \code{na_method}.
If \code{na_method} is "drop_na", missing values are dropped from the data, and the path is
still drawn, but might skipping steps due to missing values. If \code{na_method} is "drop_group",
the entire group whose missing values belong is dropped from the data, and the path is not drawn.

Ties in \code{order_by} are allowed but trigger a warning and preserve the original
row order for tied values.

Duplicates in \code{order_by} are dropped and a warning is issued.

Grouping is controlled via the usual \code{group} aesthetic. If a \code{group} column
is present in the data, reordering is performed independently within each
group; otherwise, the entire data is treated as a single path.

\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{stat_ordered_path()} understands the following aesthetics (required are in
bold).
\itemize{
\item \strong{x}
\item \strong{y}
\item \strong{order_by}
\item group
\item alpha, colour, linewidth, linetype, etc. (inherited from \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_path]{ggplot2::geom_path()}})
}
